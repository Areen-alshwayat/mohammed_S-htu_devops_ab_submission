## Gridsome CI/CD - Automated Gridsome deployment with Docker and Git

Manually setting the infartructure, deploying the website, tracking code changes and testing them is tiresome and leads to many conflicts and is the total opposite to what DevOps stands for. This can be avoided by automating the process using a container based approach. With containarization, we can setup our infrastructure as many times as we want in a negligeble time, while ensuring the same result everytime.

### Gridsome build with Docker
 __Goal:__ Build an image named gridsome-docker that contains all the necessary dependancies to run our website. 

#### Image Dockerfile 

```
FROM node:14.2.0-alpine3.10

RUN apk update && apk upgrade
RUN apk add git yarn python
RUN npm install --global chokidar
RUN npm install sharp
RUN npm install --global @gridsome/cli
RUN git clone https://github.com/Somayyah/htu-devops-konsul-web.git
RUN cd htu-devops-konsul-web/;
RUN npm rebuild
RUN yarn
RUN gridsome develop
```
To build the image use the command:
```
docker build . -t gridsome-docker
```
Docker image build --> Successfull.
